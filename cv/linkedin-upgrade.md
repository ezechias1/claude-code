What I bring to the table:

→ Software Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, Python, Git

I completed a full-time Software Development program at CodeSpace Academy (77% average) and have hands-on experience from my internship at Medwave, where I worked on marketing strategy, automation systems, video production, and business operations.

Currently working with a digital agency building client websites, creating AI-generated content, and running marketing campaigns.
